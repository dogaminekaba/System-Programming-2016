How much is that doggie in the window?
The one with the waggly tail
How much is that doggie in the window?
I do hope ecece doggie's for sale

I must take a trip to California
And leave my poor sweetheart alone
If he has a dog, he won't be lonesome
And the doggie wecececell have a good home

How much is that doggie in the window?
The one with the waggly tail
How much is that doggie in the window?
I do hope that doggie's for sale
